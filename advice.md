Executive Summary
Your girlfriend is facing an Adult Protective Services (APS) investigation in Texas, triggered by an accusation of financial exploitation made by her mother to a bank. Given that her mother is described as "bipolar" and "incognitive" (likely meaning incapacitated or suffering from cognitive impairment), and your girlfriend has legal authority to manage her mother's finances (described as "beneficiary" but likely a Power of Attorney or guardian), this situation requires careful handling. The primary goal is to provide APS with clear, factual information demonstrating that your girlfriend is acting within her legal authority and in her mother's best interests, and that the accusation is unfounded, likely stemming from her mother's medical condition.

It is highly recommended that your girlfriend consult with an attorney specializing in elder law or guardianship in Texas immediately, before speaking with APS. An attorney can provide specific legal advice, help prepare for the interview, and potentially represent her during the process.

Jurisdiction and Governing Law
This matter falls under Texas state law, specifically concerning the protection of vulnerable adults. The key statutes are:

Texas Human Resources Code, Chapter 48: This chapter outlines the duties and powers of Adult Protective Services (APS) regarding the investigation of abuse, neglect, and exploitation of elderly and disabled persons.
Texas Family Code, Chapter 48: While primarily focused on children, it also references investigations related to abuse, neglect, and exploitation of certain persons by the Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS), of which APS is a division.
Texas Penal Code, Chapter 32 (Fraud) and Chapter 31 (Theft), and potentially Chapter 22 (Assaultive Offenses, if physical harm implied): While the APS investigation is primarily civil, allegations of financial exploitation can have criminal implications if substantiated.
Legal Analysis and Application
1. Role and Authority of Texas Adult Protective Services (APS): * Mandate: APS is a division of the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) tasked with protecting adults (defined as persons 18 years or older) who are elderly or have disabilities from abuse, neglect, or exploitation. * Investigation Process: When a report (like the bank's) is received, APS is mandated to investigate. Their primary goal is to determine if abuse, neglect, or exploitation has occurred and, if so, to ensure the safety and well-being of the vulnerable adult. * Powers: APS investigators have the authority to interview the alleged victim, the alleged perpetrator, and collateral contacts (like family members, doctors, bankers). They can review relevant records (with proper consent or court order). They aim to gather facts to substantiate or un-substantiate the allegations. * Potential Outcomes: * Substantiated: If APS finds sufficient evidence that abuse, neglect, or exploitation occurred. This can lead to service referrals, court intervention (e.g., guardianship proceedings if no proper legal authority exists or is being misused), or referral to law enforcement for criminal investigation. * Unsubstantiated: If there is insufficient evidence to support the allegations. * Unable to Determine: If the evidence is inconclusive.

2. Definition of Financial Exploitation in Texas: * Under Texas law, "exploitation" often refers to the illegal or improper use of an elderly or disabled person's resources for monetary or personal profit, or other gain, without the person's consent. * The key here is "improper use" and "without consent." If your girlfriend has legal authority (e.g., a Durable Power of Attorney for financial matters or is a court-appointed guardian of the estate) and is using her mother's money for her mother's benefit and within the scope of that authority, it does not constitute financial exploitation.

3. Importance of the Mother's Mental Capacity and Your Girlfriend's Legal Role: * Mother's Condition: The mother being "bipolar" and "incognitive" is critically important. This suggests she may lack the mental capacity to make sound financial decisions or even to accurately perceive events. Her accusation to the bank, while triggering the report, may be a symptom of her condition rather than a factual statement. This should be explained to APS. * Your Girlfriend's Role: The description "beneficiary to manage her money" likely refers to a formal legal role such as: * Durable Power of Attorney (POA) for Financial Matters: This document grants the daughter authority to manage financial affairs. * Court-Appointed Guardian of the Estate: If the mother has been legally declared incapacitated by a court, a guardian would be appointed to manage her finances. * Representative Payee (for Social Security/VA benefits): While more limited, this role allows management of specific government benefits. * Trustee of a Trust: If the mother's assets are in a trust and the daughter is the trustee. * It is crucial for your girlfriend to identify the exact legal instrument or court order that grants her authority. This documentation is central to proving she has a legitimate right to manage the money. * If your girlfriend has no formal legal authority and is simply managing money informally, APS may view this as problematic, especially given the mother's accusations. This is why immediate legal consultation is vital.

4. Handling the APS Interview: * APS investigators are trained to assess situations involving vulnerable adults. They will listen to both sides. * Your girlfriend should approach the interview calmly and factually. * The core of her defense will be: * Demonstrating her legal authority to manage her mother's funds. * Providing evidence that all expenditures from her mother's accounts have been for her mother's benefit (e.g., healthcare, living expenses, personal care). * Explaining her mother's medical condition and how it affects her judgment and perceptions, providing context for the unfounded accusation.

Recommendations
Given the urgency and potential implications, here's how your girlfriend should handle this situation:

I. Immediate Action (Before the Interview):

Consult with a Texas Attorney: This is the most critical step. Seek an attorney specializing in elder law, guardianship, or probate.

An attorney can explain her rights, advise on what to say and what not to say, help her gather and organize necessary documentation, and potentially communicate with APS on her behalf.
Having legal counsel demonstrates that she takes the matter seriously and is acting responsibly.
Gather All Relevant Documentation:

Proof of Legal Authority: Obtain a copy of the Durable Power of Attorney, guardianship papers, trust documents, or other legal instruments that grant her authority to manage her mother's finances. This is paramount.
Financial Records: Compile bank statements, credit card statements (if linked to mother's accounts), receipts, invoices, and any other records that show how her mother's money has been spent. Categorize them to easily show that funds were used for her mother's care, living expenses, medical needs, etc.
Medical Records (if obtainable): Any doctor's notes, diagnoses, or evaluations concerning the mother's cognitive impairment, bipolar disorder, or other conditions that affect her judgment or perception. This helps explain why the mother might make false accusations.
Communications with the Bank: Any notes, emails, or call logs related to the incident with the bank.
Understand the Allegation: While the bank reported "stealing," APS might broaden it to "financial exploitation." Your girlfriend should be prepared to address the broader concept.

Prepare Her Narrative: She should mentally (or with her attorney) walk through the facts:

Her relationship with her mother.
The mother's medical condition and its impact on her decision-making/perceptions.
The specific legal authority she has to manage the money.
How she manages the money (e.g., a dedicated account, clear record-keeping).
A concise, factual explanation of how all funds are used for her mother's benefit.
Why the mother's accusation might be a symptom of her illness, rather than a factual statement.
II. During the Phone Interview with APS:

Be Calm and Cooperative (but Measured): Remain polite and composed. APS is investigating, not necessarily accusing.
State Her Identity and Purpose: Clearly identify herself and confirm her willingness to cooperate with the investigation.
Do Not Lie or Mislead: Be truthful. Any untruthfulness can severely undermine her credibility.
Stick to the Facts: Answer questions directly and factually. Avoid speculation, emotional outbursts, or volunteering unnecessary information. If she doesn't know an answer, say so.
Clearly Explain Her Legal Authority: State the specific legal instrument (e.g., "I am my mother's agent under a Durable Power of Attorney for Financial Matters, executed on [Date]."). Offer to provide a copy.
Explain the Mother's Condition: Gently and factually explain her mother's bipolar disorder and cognitive challenges, and how these conditions can lead to confusion, paranoia, or unfounded accusations. Frame it as a medical reality, not an insult to her mother.
Emphasize Proper Use of Funds: Explain that all of her mother's money is used solely for her mother's care and expenses. Offer to provide comprehensive financial records to verify this. (Do not send them unless requested).
Take Notes: Jot down the name of the APS investigator, the date and time of the call, and key questions asked and answers given.
Do NOT Admit Guilt: If she did not steal money, she absolutely must not admit to it, or anything that could be construed as an admission.
Right to Counsel: If questions become highly sensitive or potentially self-incriminating, she has the right to state that she would prefer to consult with her attorney before answering further. While APS is not law enforcement, invoking this right is prudent if she feels uncomfortable.
III. After the Interview:

Follow Up (as advised by attorney): Ask the APS investigator about the next steps in the process and the expected timeline.
Provide Requested Documents: If APS requests specific documents, provide copies promptly. Keep originals and copies of everything she sends.
Continue Cooperation: Remain cooperative within the bounds of legal advice.
Monitor the Situation: Be aware of any further contact from APS or any other agencies.
